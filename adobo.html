    <h3> Ingredients </h3>
    <ul>
        <li> Meat (usually pork or chicken) </li>
        <li> Vinegar (white or cane vinegar) </li>
        <li> Soy sauce </li>
        <li> Garlic </li>
        <li> Bay Leaves </li>
        <li> Whole Black Peppercorns </li>
        <li> Water (or chicken/pork broth) </li>
    </ul>

    <h3> Steps </h3>
    <ol>
        <li> Cut the meat (pork or chicken) into bite-sized pieces. </li>
        <li> In a large bowl or container, mix together the vinegar, soy sauce, garlic, bay leaves, and black peppercorns to create the marinade. </li>
        <li> Add the meat to the marinade, making sure all pieces are fully coated. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes or up to several hours for more flavor. </li>
        <li> Heat a large pot or pan over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the meat and marinade to the pot and bring to a boil. </li>
        <li> Lower the heat to a simmer and let the meat cook for about 30-45 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the meat is tender and cooked through. </li>
        <li> If the sauce is too thin, remove the meat with a slotted spoon and increase the heat to reduce the sauce to the desired consistency. If the sauce is too thick, add a bit of water or broth to thin it out. </li>
        <li> Once the meat is cooked and the sauce is at the desired consistency, remove the pot from the heat and let it cool slightly before serving. </li>
        <li> Serve with steamed rice and enjoy! </li>
